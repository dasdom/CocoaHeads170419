# Test-Driven iOS Development with Swift

# Three rules (Uncle Bob)
- You are *not allowed to write any production code* unless it is to pass a failing unit test-  You are *not allowed to write any more of a unit test* than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures- You are *not allowed to write any more production code* than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

# Red, Green, Refactor

**Red**: Write a *failing* test

**Green**: Write the *simplest* code that makes the test pass

**Refactor**: Improve the code *without breaking* the tests
